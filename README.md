# Getting Started with App

**Note: You have to have installed Node JS on your working machine. (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Install Node JS as a usual app.**

**Check whether Node JS is installed correctly through typing `node ---version` in terminal**

## Scripts 
#### 1) Clone project in the working directory `git clone ...`
#### 2) Go into the working folder (ex. cloned folder will be called 'Graphs' as a repository name)
#### 3) Once you are in working folder, install node modules through `npm install`
#### 4) Once node modules are installed you should have folder named "node_modules" on the same level with "src" and "public" folders
#### 5) Run `npm start` in your terminal to run the project

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
